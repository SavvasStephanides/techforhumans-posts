What is `aria-label` is accessibility?

## Let's explain

Suppose in your website you have a button:

```html
<button></button>
```

This button appears when there's a popup window and its job is to close that window:

```html
<button onclick="closeWindow()"></button>
```

To make the button as minimal as possible, you decide to give it a label "X", instead of "Close":

```html
<button onclick="closeWindow()">X</button>
```

So the button will look like this:

Although the button looks nice, there's a problem.

A screen reader will announce the label of the button as is. So once the button has the focus, the screen reader will say:

> Cap X, button

That doesn't really give an very good picture of what the button is supposed to do to the screen reader user. We need a clearer label, but at the same time, keep the "X" as our label.

What can we do?

We can use an attribute in our HTML, called `aria-label`.

This is how it can be used in our button:

```html
<button onclick="closeWindow()" aria-label="Close window">X</button>
```

So now the button will be announced like this:

> Close window, button

In conclusion, if you need a screen reader to announce an element separately than its actual label, use `aria-label`.
