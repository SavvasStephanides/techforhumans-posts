Both are tools in CSS that help you take a group of elements and lay them out in specific ways. 

So what does each one do and how do they differ?

To explain, let's start with a group of 5 elements:

```html
<section>
    <div>Element 1</div>
    <div>Element 2</div>
    <div>Element 3</div>
    <div>Element 4</div>
    <div>Element 5</div>
</section>
```

As you'd expect, if you run the HTML code above, each element appears below the previous. Like this (some minor styling added for emphasis):

![](/assets/gridflex1.png)

What if you don't want each element to appear one under the other? What if you want to have a navigation bar and you want the elements to appear next to each other?

Like this ðŸ‘‡

![](/assets/gridflex2.png)

Sure there are CSS hacks you could do to make them look how you want them (I'm sure you're thinking of a few right now) but they are all messy and a nightmare to maintain.

This is where Flexbox comes in! ðŸ’ª

The way it works is pretty simple. Notice how in the `HTML` code, we have a `<section>` which includes our 5 elements? ðŸ‘‡

```html
<section>
    <div>Home</div>
    <div>About</div>
    <div>Projects</div>
    <div>Skills</div>
    <div>My CV</div>
</section>
```

You can style the `<section>` like this to make it a "Flexbox":

```css
section{
  display: flex;
}
```

That's it! Now your `<div>` elements will appear next to each other, just like you want them to!

In essence, a Flexbox puts its elements in a single direction, either horizontally or vertically. Really useful for laying out elements next to each other!

Now say you have a website which has a photo gallery. A cool way to present the photos is in a grid, like this:

![](/assets/gridflex3.png)

Again, there are several ways to create a grid of photos, a lot of which are messy and clumsy.

So could Flexbox help us with this?

Technically, yes. If we do something like this:

```html
<section>
    <div class="row-divider">
      <img src="img1.png" alt="">
      <img src="img2.png" alt="">
      <img src="img3.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="row-divider">
      <img src="img4.png" alt="">
      <img src="img5.png" alt="">
      <img src="img6.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="row-divider">
      <img src="img7.png" alt="">
      <img src="img8.png" alt="">
      <img src="img9.png" alt="">
    </div>
</section>
```

Then we can make each `row-divider` a Flexbox to align our images horizontally:

```css
section .row-divider{
  display: flex;
}
```

It works! But it doesn't look particularly clean. What if there was a better way? Without needing to have a row divider? 

There is! With CSS Grid!

CSS Grid is hands-down the easiest way to create a grid layout. No more row dividers. Just plain HTML and CSS.

So your HTML would simply be this ðŸ‘‡

```html
<section>
    <img src="img1.png" alt="">
    <img src="img2.png" alt="">
    <img src="img3.png" alt="">
    <img src="img4.png" alt="">
    <img src="img5.png" alt="">
    <img src="img6.png" alt="">
    <img src="img7.png" alt="">
    <img src="img8.png" alt="">
    <img src="img9.png" alt="">
</section>
```

Now if we need to say:

> Let's create a grid with 3 columns of equal size

You can do this with 2 `CSS` statements for your `<section>`:

```css
section{
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```

That's it!

Flexbox and CSS Grid can greatly improve your workflow and simplify your code!

And that's how the two layouts differ. Thank you for reading! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
